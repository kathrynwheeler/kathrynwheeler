lead_text: "Reggaeton is one of the most popular music genres in the world. Its history is rooted in diaspora migration, censorship, poverty and the reclaiming of Afro-Caribbean identity. We go to New York, one of the homes of reggaeton's evolution, to explore the music's history and talk to those who've helped pioneer the sound and those who are changing its image."
